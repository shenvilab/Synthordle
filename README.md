# Synthordle
Thank you for playing Synthordle and for taking the time to look at our code! If you are interested in helping us build our library of problems, please reference the instruction below. 


To put in new reactions:

Step 0: Create a new folder, and name it the next available integer in the "Reactions" folder.

Step 1:
Use Chemdraw to draw out the starting material, product, and each of the intermediates and individually save them as png files. Fit a white square around your compound before you export from ChemDraw to ensure a square image in order to avoid image distortion. A template with the ChemDraw settings that we use in the Shenvi lab is provided. 

Name of files sm.png, int0.png, int1.png, int2.png, and product.png. 

Step 2:
Draw out the conditions and fit them into the reagents box (adjust your font size and do NOT resize the box!) Please use Helvetic Neue Light as the font!

Briefly look through the reagents that are currently in the folder; try to reuse any existing reagents, if possible. For example, NaBH4 (already in the folder) can be used in many reactions and you do not need to add a new image to the folder.

Save the reagents in the "Reagents" folder and name them in a general manner for ease of browsing. 

Step 3: 
Edit "reactions.json" to include your reaction. Your reaction ID should be the next available number. Sequence should be the correct order of reagents (in the forward sense!), and please provide the appropriate reference, if applicable. 

Step 4: Commit your branch and put in a merge request. We will review it, make any necessary edits, and approve it at our earliest availability.

Step 5:
Please send us an email: kzong@scripps.edu and rshenvi@scripps.edu so that we can properly credit you for submitting a problem! Thank you for your contribution and please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions!
